    <h1>Founder’s Note</h1>
    <p class="lead">Covenant over commerce. Discipline over hype.</p>

    <p>
      AGEx was born from a personal call to build order where chaos has ruled for too long.
      I learned that many people don’t fail because they are lazy — they fail because nobody gave them a clear system to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey taught me that stewardship comes before success: discipline before freedom, structure before increase.
      AGEx exists to help serious learners build financial intelligence and verifiable skills — so they can earn with dignity and grow with direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      This platform is not “get-rich-quick.” It is a guided learning environment designed for accountability, proof, and progress.
      If you are willing to learn, commit to discipline, and build your future with patience, you are welcome here.
    </p>
